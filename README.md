Calculate victory probilities for Warcry units in melee combat

How to use:
Step 1. Select unit types, either from menu or by selecting "Custom" and entering unit attributes.
Step 2. Hit Calculate. 

Explanation:
Two graphs are displayed, showing the probability of each unit's survival after 4 battle rounds. 
The calculator assumes that one unit initiates with a move plus (melee) attack. The units then 
exchange double (melee) attacks until one is defeated. The top graph shows the survival 
probability of the units after each attack action if Unit 1 initiates. The bottom graph shows 
the survival probability of the units after each attack action if Unit 1 initiates. The lowest 
panels averages the final results of both graphs after 4 battle rounds to produce an overall
win rate.
